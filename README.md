# Mini-projects

This repository contains a collection of my mini web development projects. Each project is a small build created to improve my frontend skills and explore new ideas.

They include interactive and visually styled pages, using basic web technologies to create fun and useful user experiences.

Feel free to explore, learn, and build on them!
